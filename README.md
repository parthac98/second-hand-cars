# Things are able to covered
1. Responciveness of the application
2. Access the data from the provided RestAPI
3. Rearranged the data as needed
4. Shown the data in the front end by tile manner
5. Highlited the tile (car) according to the value of the lisence
6. Shown almost 98% data in the tile about cars
7. By clicking Fav button and Add to cart button actually storing the data to the JSON object

# Thing are not able to cover
1. Sorting and Formatting (I think to do this I need to change the structure of the JSON data, I wasted time to find out the way)
2. Did not made the more info popup because 98% data are already shown in the tile and also jquery is not working. This is also the reason that not able to make CART popup (need to find out the reason)

# More addition could have been done
Though the main JSON object is updating by the value of 'FAV' and 'Add To Cart' we can easyli make the changes to the UI as we want. But I was out of time.
